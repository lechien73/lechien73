## Hi, I'm Matt

I'm a software developer with over 30 years' experience, which makes me very much a dinosaur. If I had one, I'm sure my beard would be grey 🧔🏼‍♂️.

I'm a full-stack developer, tech educator and curriculum consultant. I've worked with large and small organisations, in startups and established companies.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Matt Tools - making public the tools I've made to speed up my own development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust. Oh yeah.
- 👯 I’m open to working with companies who want my particular brand of goofy-humoured tech education
- 📫 Reach me by email, LinkedIn or send a special carrier pigeon. They all know where I live.
